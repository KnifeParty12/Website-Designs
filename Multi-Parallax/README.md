# Mutilayer-Parallax 

> As parallax has become a trend and you might are seeing this kind of animations on social media pages related to design inspiration as well,I have tried to manipulate this with multiple layers.

> I downloaded an image (attached with source code) from 'unsplash.com' and split it into two layers. Then after, I rendered clouds and text layers to make it look more realistic and for better user experience.
