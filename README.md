## [Multilayer-Parallax](Website-Designs/Multi-Parallax/index.html) (RellaxJs)
<ul>
<li> As parallax has become a trend and you might are seeing this kind of animations on social media pages related to design inspiration as well
<li>I have tried to manipulate this with multiple layers.
<li>I downloaded an image (attached with source code) from 'unsplash.com' and split it into two layers.
<li>Then after, I rendered clouds and text layers to make it look more realistic and for better user experience.  
</ul>
